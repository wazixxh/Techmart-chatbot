# TechMart Support Agent

Next.js customer-support chat application backed by Gemini, Google Sheets, and optional Resend email delivery.

## Local setup

1. Install Node.js 20+.
2. Run `npm.cmd ci`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values.
4. Share the Products, Orders, and Interactions spreadsheets with the Google service-account email.
5. Run `npm.cmd run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.

The API route is `/api/chat`. All Google and email credentials are server-side only.

## Configuration

`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` authenticates Gemini. The Google service-account variables and three sheet IDs configure catalog reads, order reads, and interaction writes. `RESEND_API_KEY` is optional during development; when omitted, refund requests are recorded but email delivery is marked pending.

## Verification

Run these before deployment:

```powershell
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run build
```

The refund flow always re-checks the order and return window, requires explicit confirmation, and prevents duplicate requests found in the interactions sheet.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
